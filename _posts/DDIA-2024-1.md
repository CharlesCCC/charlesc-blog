#### **Reliability**

- Continuing to work correctly, even when things go wrong. 
    - aka. _fault-tolerant or resilient_.
- **Fault vs. Failure** (fault means one component failed), design system that able tolerance the fault to prevent failure; 
- **Hardware Faults**: Redundancy is  the key; 
- **Software Errors**: could be more troublesome; 
    - Developers need to make assumptions and interactions carefully. 
- **Human Errors**: Design to minimize chances of errors; decouple; Test thoroughly; Quick recover ability; monitoring(performance/error rate), aka Telemetry; Good management practice/training; 

#### **Scalability**:

- A system’s ability to cope with increased load.  
- **Describing Load**:  defined by “load parameters”, it depend on architecture of your system, e.g. 
    - the **requests per second** to a web server, 
    - the **ratio of reads to writes** in a database, 
    - the **number of simultaneously active users** in a chatroom, 
    - the **hit rate** on a **cache**, etc.
- Twitter hybrid approach: fanned-out vs. fetched

- the average rate of published tweets is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the rate of home timeline reads → Fanned-Out approach
    - On average, a tweet is delivered to about 75 followers, so 4.6k tweets per second become 345k writes per second to the home timeline caches.
    - Moved to Hybrid approach to handle Justin-Biber effects. 
- **Describing Performance**: When you increase a load parameter, keep the same system resources, what will happen ? How much do you need to increase resources to keep up the performance ? 
    - E.g. “**response time**”— the time between a client sending a request and receiving a response. 
    - **Latency vs. response time**: Latency is the duration that a request is waiting to be handled—during which it is latent, awaiting service.
    - Better use “**percentiles**” to measure response time, e.g. median(p50)  
        ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NxaCpsS9OhNiEGb3bBmQFU8-EtLqxbbm9BNXY_DJOb-WqQw3Av33KSs68bXV2JNoTDUM8OTjjzxLhBUf8xaLhfFE14UPIJbO4xTKBDlHlhWmCm6mVZ4TFhk6te0Bb4Gc8E9x9jzq) 
        - High percentiles of response times, also known as **tail latencies**, are important because they directly affect users’ experience of the service.
        - Amazon describes response time requirements for internal services in terms of the 99.9th percentile (affects 1 in 1,000 requests). 
            - On the other hand, optimizing the 99.99th percentile (the slowest 1 in 10,000 requests) was deemed too expensive and to not yield enough benefit for Amazon’s purposes.
        - Amazon has also observed that a 100 ms increase in response time reduces sales by 1% \[20\], and others report that a 1-second slowdown reduces a customer satisfaction metric by 16%
        - **It is important to** **measure response times** **on the client side**.
- **Approaches for Coping with Load**:
    - Good architectures usually involve a pragmatic mixture of approaches: **Scaling up**(Vertical) & **Scaling out**(horizontal) 
        - Scaling out: **Stateless** service is fairly straightforward compared to **Stateful** service.  
    - It is conceivable that distributed data systems will become the default in the future.
    - The architecture of systems that operate at large scale is usually highly specific to the application.
    - An scalable architecture usually built from general-purpose building blocks arranged in familiar patterns. 

#### **Maintainability**:

- **Operability**: Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly.
- **Simplicity**: Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, 
    - By removing as much complexity as possible from the system. (Note: this is not the same as simplicity of the user interface.)
    - Making a system simpler DOES NOT necessarily mean reducing its functionality;
    - **Complexity**: as accidental if it is not inherent in the problem that the software solves (as seen by the users) but arises only from the implementation.
        - One of the best tools we have for removing accidental complexity is **abstraction**. (However,finding good abstractions is very hard.)
- **Evolvability**:Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future, adapting it for unanticipated use cases as requirements change. Also known as **extensibility**, **modifiability**, or **plasticity**.
    - **Agile** working patterns provide a framework for adapting to change
    - simple and easy-to-understand systems are usually easier to modify than complex ones (Linked to the previous point - **Maintainability**) 

#### Summary

- **functional requirements**: (what it should do, such as allowing data to be stored, retrieved, searched, and processed in various ways),
- **nonfunctional requirements**: (general properties like security, reliability, compliance, scalability, compatibility, and maintainability)
- **Reliability** means making systems work correctly, even when faults occur.
- **Scalability** means having strategies for keeping performance good, even when load increases.
- **Maintainability** has many facets, but in essence it’s about making life better for the engineering and operations teams who need to work with the system.
